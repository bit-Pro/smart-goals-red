# SMARTgoals
Use the issues tracker for this repo to discuss each of the following goals. You are to assess how SMART each one is, and decide whether it can be used as-is or needs to be changed.

SMART in this context = Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound.

Once you have decided what needs fixing, each member of your group should be assigned a goal to rewrite and must make a new branch to make changes.

All changes must be merged back in using a pull request that is to be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging. Follow the lecturer's instructions to protect the master branch in order to require manditory reviewing before merging.

### Goals to review:

1. Hold a team meeting a minimum of once a week for the duration of the semester
2. Attend every single meeting this semester
3. Improve my writing in the PP2 class by the end of semester
4. Watch Lynda.com
5. Learn the basics of Photoshop each week
6. Complete all set homework by its due date
7. Read a book about leadership before the end of semester
